Several different libraries were used in this project:

1. Processing
2. ControlP5
3. Ani

Some difficulties that were found:

1. The controlP5 objects were not able to be animated and hold their listener at the same time. 
   The animations was done successful but, because their listeners depends on their name, so we decided to use static controlP5 objects and animated Ani objects.
   
2. The constructors of the Ani objects depended on the information of the JSON files, which were parsed on the load() method.
   We decided to construct the "characters" arraylist to hold the data and then reconstruct them as the "circles" arraylist.
   
Instructions to use:

1. In order to select / change episode, use the menu bar at the top.
2. The actors are by default in a circle that represents the selected episode. 
   In order to interact with them, click in their names on the left side.
3. When two or more actors have a link, a line will appear between them, and the number above the line represents the amount of times the actors spoke to each other.
4. The "clear all" and "select all" buttons deselect and selects all the actors in that particular episode.

NOTES:

1. Because the Ani objects have their delay in the animations, the "Drawing... please wait..." label was implemented.
2. Each time an actor is selected / deselected, the program needs to verify:
   2.1   All the selected/deselected actors and add/remove them from the circle.
   2.2   All the links between the remaining actors.

Animation design (EXTRA 20%):

A customized animation was implemented in this project. 
1. When selecting the actors, they use the Ani.QUINT_IN_OUT animation to move to the circle.
2. When deselecting an actor, it keeps using the Ani.QUINT_IN_OUT animation and goes to the right side of the window above the "clear all" and "select all" buttrons in its respective position.
